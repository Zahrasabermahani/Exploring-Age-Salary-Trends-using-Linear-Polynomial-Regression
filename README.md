# Exploring-Age-Salary-Trends-using-Linear-Polynomial-Regression

-  **Goal**: Predict salary based on age using both Linear and Polynomial Regression models.  
-  **Tools Used**: Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn  
-  **Techniques**:
  - Data visualization (scatter plots)
  - Data standardization
  - Train/validation/test split
  - Linear Regression modeling
  - Polynomial Regression (degree = 3)
  - RÂ² score evaluation and interpretation
-  **Outcome**: Polynomial regression captured the nonlinear trend more effectively than linear models, showing that salary increases with age to a point before declining, likely due to retirement effects.
-  **Skills Practiced**: Feature scaling, model fitting, error analysis, data splitting, model comparison
