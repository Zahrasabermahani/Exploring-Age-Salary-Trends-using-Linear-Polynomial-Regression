# Exploring-Age-Salary-Trends-using-Linear-Polynomial-Regression
Hands-on ML project to predict salary using age with data visualization and model evaluation.


I explored a dataset mapping individual ages to their salaries, using Python and scikit-learn.
Steps included data visualization, preprocessing, model fitting, and evaluation:

__Trained both Linear Regression and 3rd-degree Polynomial Regression

__Evaluated models using RÂ² score on validation data

__Found that a nonlinear model better captured the age-salary relationship, which tends to rise and fall due to retirement effects

This hands-on project helped me reinforce key ML workflow concepts like standardization, splitting datasets, and model evaluation.
